% describe the process of preparing data

% (1) SKBtrialextract('Pinky'):
%       store extracted epochs in \Projects\FCAnalysis\data\Pinky\epochs
%
%       post process: 
%           a. (manually) delete the file not having lfptrial_cortical as the
%                         variable is larger than 2G because of the very long execuation time (Pinky_050417-Block3)
%   
%           b. checktrials(): can check the sample rate, channel numbers
%           across all the files
%
% (2) epochs_reorg():
%       downsample the data to 1.017e+03 (fs for some files from (1) are 1.017e+03 or 3.0518+03) and extract the used channels 
%
%       store the reorganized extracted epochs to .\Pinky\epochs_reorg
%       using data in Pinky\epochs
%       
%
% (3) band filtered
