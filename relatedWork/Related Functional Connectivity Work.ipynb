    "        * Increased resting-state cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the 8–10 Hz alpha range is a feature of PD from the earliest clinical stages onward. With disease progression, neighboring frequency bands become increasingly involved. These findings suggest that changes in functional coupling over the course of PD may be linked to the topographical progression of pathology over the brain.. \n",
